# Vietnamese to Telex input

Transform accented Vietnamese to its telex equivalent. I use this to create Vietnamese keyboard
layouts, perhaps you might find use in this little tool too.

## Usage

```sh
cargo install --path .
viet-telex <input-file> -o <output-file>
```

Also usable as a library with the `viet_telex` function.
